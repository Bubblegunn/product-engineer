# Install

## With skills.sh

```
npx skills add Bubblegunn/product-engineer
```

That is the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) installer. It detects the agents in the current
project and places every skill in this repository for each of them; `--all` targets every
supported agent, `-g` installs for your user instead of the project, and the interactive
prompt lets you pick a subset.

## Where it lands

| agent | path after `npx skills add` |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/<skill>/` |
| Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI and other agents that read the shared skills directory | `.agents/skills/<skill>/` |
| Windsurf, Roo, Kiro, Trae, Qwen Code, CodeBuddy, Goose and others with their own directory | `.<agent>/skills/<skill>/` |

Verified on 5 September 2026 with `npx skills add Bubblegunn/product-engineer --all --copy`
in an empty repository: four skills found, placed for 56 agent directories.

## The pack

| skill | install it when |
|---|---|
| `product-engineer` | your agent writes code and you want all seven rules |
| `customer-block` | you only want the "For the customer" block in commits and pull requests |
| `done-means-observed` | you only want honest completion reports: what was watched, what could not be checked |
| `release-notes` | the agent writes release notes, changelogs or status updates rather than code |

## Agents that read instruction files instead

The repository also carries the seven rules as generated files for agents that never open
a skills folder: `.cursor/rules/product-engineer.mdc`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`,
`GEMINI.md` with `gemini-extension.json`, `.clinerules/`, `.kiro/steering/`,
`.windsurf/rules/` and `AGENTS.md`. Copy the one your agent reads into your project. They
are generated from `skills/product-engineer/SKILL.md` by `scripts/generate-adapters.mjs`
and CI refuses a commit where they differ.

| agent | copy this file | notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cursor | [`examples/cursor/.cursor/rules/product-engineer.mdc`](../examples/cursor/.cursor/rules/product-engineer.mdc) | `alwaysApply: true`; see [`cursor.md`](cursor.md) for the globs variant |
| Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` with `gemini-extension.json` | |
| Cline | `.clinerules/product-engineer.md` | |
| Kiro | `.kiro/steering/product-engineer.md` | `inclusion: always` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/rules/product-engineer.md` | `trigger: always_on` |
| Codex and others | `AGENTS.md` | |

## Claude Code plugin

```
/plugin marketplace add Bubblegunn/product-engineer
/plugin install product-engineer@bubblegunn
```

Both commands were run and verified; `claude plugin validate .` passes.

## By hand

Copy `skills/<skill>/` into `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, or your agent's skills
directory.

## Git hook

`sh scripts/install-hook.sh` copies `scripts/commit-msg` into `.git/hooks/`. A commit
without the block is refused with a two-line explanation. Merge, fixup, squash and revert
commits pass, and `[no-customer]` anywhere in the message opts one commit out.

## CI

```yaml
name: customer block
on: [pull_request]
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write   # for the comment; drop it and set comment: "false" to keep the log as the only report
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: Bubblegunn/product-engineer@v0
        # with: { warn: "true" }      # report instead of failing
        # with: { comment: "false" }  # no pull request comment
```

The action fails the pull request when its description has no "For the customer" block,
annotates the run with the other findings, and leaves one comment on the pull request: the
verdict, the findings, and the block to paste when it is missing. The comment is updated in
place on every push, never duplicated. A pull request from a fork runs with a read-only
token, so there the comment becomes a warning in the log and the check still runs.

Inputs: `pr` (defaults to the event's pull request), `warn`, `comment`, `token`.

## pre-commit

`.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Bubblegunn/product-engineer
    rev: v0.3.0
    hooks:
      - id: product-engineer-check
```

Then `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`.

## lefthook

`lefthook.yml`:

```yaml
commit-msg:
  commands:
    customer-block:
      run: npx product-engineer check {1}
```

## husky

`.husky/commit-msg`:

```sh
npx product-engineer check "$1"
```

## commitlint

`commitlint.config.mjs`:

```js
export { default } from "product-engineer/commitlint";
```

One rule, `customer-block`, as an error. To add it to a config you already have, see
[`integrations/commitlint/`](../integrations/commitlint/README.md).

## Checking what is installed

```
npx product-engineer doctor
```

It looks in this project and in your home directory for the places the surveyed agents
keep their copy, and reports each one as current or out of date by comparing its rules
against the packaged `SKILL.md`. Agents keep their own copies, so a project updated months
ago keeps running the rules it was given. The command exits 1 when a copy is out of date,
which is enough for a scheduled job to notice.
