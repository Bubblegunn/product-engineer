// Resolve the evidence a message points at.

// Suggested by @raju_dandigam on dev.to (2026-09-12): can the observed evidence be made
// machine-checkable in CI, each claim linked to a test, a screenshot or a trace artifact, without
// turning the block into boilerplate? The second half of that question decides the design.
//
// A checker that DEMANDS a link gets links. It would be satisfied by a path typed from memory, and
// the first person to notice would be the reader who followed one and found nothing. So nothing here
// requires a reference: a message with none is reported as having none, at info level, and passes.
// What this does is resolve the references that are already there, which is the half that cannot be
// gamed into ceremony. A citation that does not resolve is worse than no citation, because it reads
// as evidence.
//
// Offline by design. A path is checked against the working tree; a run URL is checked for shape
// only. Nothing here makes a network request.
