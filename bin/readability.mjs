// Flesch reading ease, Flesch (1948), "A new readability yardstick", Journal of Applied
// Psychology 32(3), counts syllables per word and words per sentence in English.
// Ateşman (1997), "Türkçede okunabilirliğin ölçülmesi", Dil Dergisi 58, is the Turkish
// recalibration of the same shape. LIX, Björnsson (1968), counts long words instead of
// syllables.
//
// All three are defined on an alphabet whose words are separated by spaces and whose
// syllables can be counted from runs of Latin vowels. Every other script breaks at least one
// of those assumptions: some are written without spaces between words, some without the
// vowels being counted, and for the rest, including Cyrillic, Greek and Devanagari, no
// calibration of these formulas is implemented here. So this module scores Latin script and
// refuses everything else by name, because rule 5 of the skill is that a number comes from a
// count, and a refusal is more useful than a confident zero.
