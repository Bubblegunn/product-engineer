# Contributing

Thank you for reading this far. The skill is short on purpose, so every change to it is
visible. Three kinds of contribution are welcome.

## Propose a rule change

Open an issue with the "Rule proposal" template. One before/after pair is required: show
what an agent writes today and what it would write under your rule, on a realistic task.
A rule that cannot be shown in a before/after is not ready.

A new rule, or a change to one, ships with an eval task under `evals/tasks/` and a
before/after pair in `references/`; a reference-only change needs the pair.

Changes to `skills/product-engineer/SKILL.md` keep it under 120 lines. Long material goes
into `references/`.

## Fix or extend a reference file

`references/plain-language.md`, `references/commit-template.md`, `references/five-questions.md`,
`references/definition-of-done.md` and `references/not-shipped.md` take pull requests directly.
Keep the tone: plain sentences, no jargon left unexplained, no em dashes.

## Add a skill

`skills/` is the pack. A skill joins it when an eval task measures what it claims, and lives in
`skills/.experimental/` until then. `test/skill-structure.sh` enforces this: a skill in the pack
must declare `metadata.measuredBy` naming metrics that `evals/score.mjs` actually scores, and the
test fails on a missing declaration or an invented metric name. Copying a directory into `skills/`
is not enough to join the pack.

An experimental skill is still installed. `npx skills add` walks the repository to a depth of five
and skips only `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build` and `__pycache__`, verified by reading
`skills@1.5.23`, so a dotted directory hides nothing. The only marker that travels with the file is
its own description, which is why a skill in `.experimental/` must open its description with
`Experimental:` and must not declare `measuredBy`.

To promote one: add a task under `evals/tasks/` that exercises the skill, run `sh evals/run.sh`,
put the numbers in `evals/RESULTS.md`, then move the directory up and declare the metrics.

What the eval covers today is narrower than the pack, and the gate does not pretend otherwise:
`evals/run.sh` copies only `skills/product-engineer` into the work tree, so the other three are
measured through the rules they share with it rather than on their own. `release-notes` is the
weakest case and says so in its own `measuredGap`. A task that writes release notes is the most
useful contribution this repository could take.

## Translate

A `README.<lang>.md` next to `README.md`, and, if you want, a `plain-language.<lang>.md` in
`references/`. Keep the code blocks and the before/after examples in English so they match
what agents actually emit. Add your language to the language line at the top of `README.md`.

## Before you push

```
npm test
```

That runs the structure script, the hook test, the check, adapter, scorer, integration and
readability tests, and refuses generated adapters that disagree with `SKILL.md` (run
`node scripts/generate-adapters.mjs` after editing it). CI runs the same on Ubuntu and macOS.

## Commits

Every commit in this repository ends with the block the skill asks for:

```
For the customer:
What changed: ...
Why it matters: ...
```

`sh scripts/install-hook.sh` installs the hook that checks it. Merge, fixup and revert
commits pass without the block; `[no-customer]` in the message opts one commit out.

## Releasing

Maintainers only. One command; the workflow does the rest.

1. Write the `## X.Y.Z (unreleased)` entry in `CHANGELOG.md` and merge it.
2. On a clean, green `main`: `npm run release -- X.Y.Z` (or `patch`, `minor`, `major`; add `--dry-run` to see the plan). It dates the entry, sets the version in `package.json`, `CITATION.cff`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and the pinned `uses:` line in the README, runs the tests, commits, tags `vX.Y.Z`, pushes, and then moves the major tag (`v0` today) to the release and force-pushes it, so `uses: Bubblegunn/product-engineer@v0` follows the newest release in that major. The major tag moves from this command and not from the workflow because release tags are admin-only by ruleset; a workflow token could not move it.
3. Watch the `release` workflow: it publishes to npm with provenance, creates the GitHub release from the CHANGELOG entry, and installs the published version from the registry on three operating systems.

CI runs `scripts/release-gate.mjs` on every push: the version must agree across those files and `npm pack` may ship only the paths in `scripts/pack-allowlist.txt` (regenerate with `node scripts/release-gate.mjs --update` when the package layout changes on purpose).

The workflow uses npm trusted publishing and holds no token. Before the first tagged release the maintainer configures the trusted publisher on npmjs.com: package settings, Trusted publishing, GitHub Actions, repository `Bubblegunn/product-engineer`, workflow `release.yml`, "Allow npm publish" ticked.

## What a review here looks like

This is a promise about how your pull request is treated, written down so you can hold it to it.

**You get a real review, quickly.** Not a rubber stamp and not a queue. Every outside pull request so
far has been reviewed the same day it arrived.

**Your work gets checked, not admired.** If you send a test, it gets run against something broken to
confirm it fails; if you send a fix, the bug gets reproduced before and after. When that happens the
review says exactly what was tried, and the throwaway code used to check it is handed to you, because
it is more useful in your hands than in a maintainer's terminal.

**A change request comes with the answer**, not just the objection: the file, the shape, and why the
first idea does not work. If something is refused, the reason is given plainly and whatever part of
your work was used still gets the credit.

**A review written against a stale commit is a mistake on this side.** If you push while a review is
being written, say so; the review will be redone against your head rather than leaving you to argue
with a comment about a bug you already fixed.

**Your name goes in three places when it merges**, and stays there: the changelog entry, the README
beside the thing you built, and the commit itself, because merges are squashed with your authorship
intact and never rewritten under someone else's name.

**You are told when it ships.** A merge is a promise; a release is the thing you can show somebody. You
get a message on your pull request with the version and the install command when your code is live.

**And you get thanked, in words.** Reviewing your code carefully is respect, but it is not the same as
saying thank you, and both are owed.
